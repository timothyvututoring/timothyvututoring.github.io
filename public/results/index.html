<p><em>Tim was an incredible mentor throughout high school, guiding me through challenging subjects like CS, AP Math, and AP Chemistry with patience and clarity. His dedication not only helped me excel academically but also played a key role in my acceptance to Georgia Tech’s CS program and ultimately landing a job at Meta. I highly recommend him to anyone looking for a dedicated and knowledgeable tutor.</em>

<!-- *"Tim gave me my first introduction to **Java programming** in the summer of 2019. His patient guidance and deep understanding of computer science helped me build a strong foundation in programming. Over the years, Tim continued to mentor me, providing support through challenging coursework and college applications. Thanks to his help, I was accepted into **Georgia Tech**’s top-ranked computer science program and recently completed a software engineering internship at **Meta**. None of this would have been possible without Tim's consistent support and expertise."*  
– **Sachin Y.**

*"Thanks to his tutoring over the years, I went from struggling with **Algebra 2** in high school to confidently excelling in **Calculus** in college at Auburn University. I can’t recommend Tim enough!"*
