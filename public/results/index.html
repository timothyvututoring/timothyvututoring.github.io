<!-- *"Tim gave me my first introduction to **Java programming** in the summer of 2019. His patient guidance and deep understanding of computer science helped me build a strong foundation in programming. Over the years, Tim continued to mentor me, providing support through challenging coursework and college applications. Thanks to his help, I was accepted into **Georgia Tech**’s top-ranked computer science program and recently completed a software engineering internship at **Meta**. None of this would have been possible without Tim's consistent support and expertise."*  
– **Sachin Y.**

*"Thanks to his tutoring over the years, I went from struggling with **Algebra 2** in high school to confidently excelling in **Calculus** in college at Auburn University. I can’t recommend Tim enough!"*
